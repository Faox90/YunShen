Character profile:

YunShen lives in the mine and is a neighbor of the dwarf. (YunShen: "I don't know him, I just live next to him.")

She is also a homegirl and never goes out (except for festivals). (YunShen: "Oh, thank you~ It's a routine for NPCs to go out on festivals, and I can't be exempt from it~")

She seems to have a painful past. As your relationship with her gets better and better, she will unconsciously mention her past to you and the impact of these past experiences on her. (YunShen: "Uh, I know, it's just complaining. In fact, I also know that I complain too much, but this is not help, hehe~")

She has her own set of values, is absolutely loyal to herself, will not betray herself, but will hurt herself. (Yun Shen: “…I cannot deny that I am indeed a selfish person.”)

Author's words (complaint):

Yes, I made another character who never goes out and lives in a small room. It is my greatest effort to prevent them from sleeping on the street. After all, I have never liked those decorations since I was a child. Home games, it gives me a headache just by looking at them...(=_=")

This character does not have a 14-heart event plot after marriage, because I can't think of anything to write. I may or may not make up for it in the future. I need inspiration and motivation, so it's up to fate. :)

The 8-heart affection event originally had a CG, but my attempt to add the CG failed, so there was only a black screen during the event. I'm sorry I'm too bad. :(

The dialogue after marriage is very, very watery, the affection event plot is stupid, and there are a lot of bugs as seasoning. I wish players a happy game~(*^▽^*)

The creator is a computer and English idiot, and uses the simplest code. If there is a bug, I may not be able to fix it, but you can still leave me a message on n.com, and I will try my best to remedy it. I am very sorry that you may have a bad gaming experience. o(> <；)
